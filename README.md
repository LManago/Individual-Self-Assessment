# Individual-Self-Assessment

### Self Assessment

Through the last 24 weeks I have learned and had the ability to apply so much knowledge. This class has helped me learn in-depth visualizations that I am able to use at work. I really am happy that I took the challenge and measured up against the challenges that I had weekly. I would definitely recommend this class to others because of the awesome tools I learned.

### Team Assessment

The team that I worked with was awesome! We all pitched in to help each other and where we all may have fell short. We communicated effectively and were very patient with each other. I couldn't have asked for a better group of teammates.

### Final Project

The final project focused on the analysis of storms in Florida. We used the Logistic Regression Model for the Machine Learning portion of the final project. The percent accuracy of the model was 70%, which means we probably should have looked at different models for the type of data used. The results of the analysis were the likelihood of a storm during the summer months was high.
